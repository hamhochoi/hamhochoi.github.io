## WEEK 2

### EDA
- Build inituition about data: 
  - Get domain knowledge
  - Checking if data is intuitive: (i.e: a typo of age=336). 
  - Understand how data was generated (i.e: train and test set were generated with different algorithms --> **test set distribution is differ from train set distribution** --> cannot split train set into train-valid and use this validation set to validate). 
    - We can check this by see the correlation between validation score and the leaderboard score.

- Exploring anomalized data (advanced topic!)
  - Some organization want to hide their data by encoded text.
  - Can see the important of each feature and plot them (i.e RandomForest: plt.plot(model.feature_importances_))
