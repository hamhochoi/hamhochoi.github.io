## WEEK 2

### EDA
- Build inituition about data: 
  - Get domain knowledge
  - Checking if data is intuitive: (i.e: a typo of age=336). 
  - Understand how data was generated (i.e: train and test set were generated with different algorithms --> **test set distribution is differ from train set distribution** --> cannot split train set into train-valid and use this validation set to validate). 
    - We can check this by see the correlation between validation score and the leaderboard score.

- Exploring anomalized data (advanced topic!)
  - Some organization want to hide their data by encoded text.
  - Can see the important of each feature and plot them (i.e RandomForest: plt.plot(model.feature_importances_))
  
- Exploring individual feature
```
  - df.dtypes
  - df.info()
  - x.value_counts()
  - x.isnull()
```
  
- Visualization  
  - Explore individual feature: ** Never conclude by using only one plot. If you have a hypothesis, try difference plots to prove it. ** 
    - Plots: ``` plt.plot(x) ```
    - Histograms: ``` plt.hist(x) ```
    - Statistics: ```df.describe(); x.mean(); x.var(); x.value_counts(); x.isnull()```
  - Explore feature correlations
    - Scatter plots: ```plt.scatter(x1, x2); pd.scatter_matrix(df); df.corr(), plt.matshow(...)```; grouping/clustering  ```df.mean().sort_values().plot(style='.')``` ![](/how-to-win-data-science-competition-learn-from-top-kaggler/images/groups.png)
    - Correlation plots
    - Plot (index vs feature statistics)

    - ...
    
- Data Cleaning
  - Constant feature: ```traintest.nunique(axis==1) == 1```; a constant value in train set but a different constant value in test set --> remove all these features. 
  - Duplicate feature: 
    - numerical: ``` traintest.T.drop_dupplicates() ```; 
    - categorical: 2 features dupplicates but values have different names.
    ![](/how-to-win-data-science-competition-learn-from-top-kaggler/images/dupplicate_features.png)
  - Duplicate rows: find dupplicate rows, understand why it is dupplicated (random or a mistake in coding?)
  - Check if data is shuffled: plot target feature with row index. It can tell about data leakage!
  - ** Visualization everything possible about dataset! **
