## WEEK 3

### Metric optimization

- Regression metric:
  - MSE, RMSE, R-squared

  - MAE
  - (R)MSPE (Mean Squared Percentage Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  [](/how-to-win-data-science-competition-learn-from-top-kaggler/images/mspe_mape.png)
  - (R)MSLE (Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error)
  [](/how-to-win-data-science-competition-learn-from-top-kaggler/images/rmsle_metric.png)
  - Notes: MAE is more robust, less sensitive with outliers than MSE. If unexpected values should be cared, then use MSE.
  
- Classification metric
  - Acc, AUC, logloss
  - Cohen's (Quadratic weighted) Kappa
