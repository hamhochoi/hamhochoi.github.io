## WEEK 5: Image Segmentation

- Hough Transform: Line detection
- Ostu algorithms: 
  - Seperate background and foreground by using threshold to move part of histogram related to background.
  - Not work if there is much noise, so that histogram of background and foreground aren't seperated. Can handle this case, we can use denoise technique.
  - Assumption: In-class intensity are close, so we can seperate each class by seperate the histogram.

  - We try to minimize the weighted variance of ways of seperating the histogram. In which, t: threshold; q(t): probability of class 1 with threshold <=t, by sum up the probabilities of every pixel in this class; p(t): probability of class 2 with threshold >t, by sum up the probabilities of every pixel in this class.
