## Week 4: Image restoration

- Type of Noise:
  - Gaussian noise: Mathematical useful
  - Rayleigh noise: appear in physical devices
  - Gamma noise
  - Expotential noise: useful when model operation in images
  - Uniform noise
  - Impulse noise (salt and pepper): each pixel have a probability, depends on that probability, pixel will be unchange/set to zero (salt)/set to one(pepper).
