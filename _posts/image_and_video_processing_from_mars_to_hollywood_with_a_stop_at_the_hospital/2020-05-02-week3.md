### Image enhancing: Intensity Transformation and Spatial Filtering
- Negative Transformation: S = L - r 
  - S: new intensity
  - L: max intensity
  - r: original intensity

- Gamma Correction
  - Input image usually be displayed on a monitor (screen/camera/...). The monitor perceive pixel intensity different with human and usually display images **darker**.To make displayed images can be human closely, gamma correction could be applied.

  - By default, gamma = 1/2.2 will make images look more brighter. To make image darker, we can set gamma=3/4/5/...
  

- Contrast Stretching
  - A good image should have wide range distributed of pixel, means that have high level of contrast.
  - When a image have low level of contrast, and we want to highly the specific area in the image, at the same time, we know the range of intensify of that area --> We can make pixels of that area higher/lower to have a better contrast.
  - To know what is the range of intensify, we need to examine the image.

- Histogram Equalization
  - A good image should have wide range distributed of pixel. Which means it should have a flatten histogram --> Histogram Equalization
  - The motivation of this transformation is thinking of intensifies as continuous random variables X, Y on [0, L-1] where Y is defined:

  - Then, we can prove that:

  - It means we have a normalized/flatten histogram. But because of X, Y is discrete variable not continuous, so in reality, we don't have a normalized histogram but very close to it.

- Histogram Matching
  - Given a histogram distribution (A). The problem is make the original histogram of image into the given histogram as close as possible.
  - We know how to transform original image into histogram equalization version (1). We also know to transform the given histogram into it's histogram equalization (2) (which close to (1)). So that, to make original image into given histogram, we can histogram qualization the original image, then **invert** the histogram equalization process of (2).

  - To get A, it depend on applications.
  - We can get better result if do histogram equalization for each region of the image instead of make it globally.
  
- Mean Filter: Apply Gaussian function (i.e: [1, 2, 1]) into image
- Median Filter
- Derivative, Laplacian Filter (second derivative)
- Unsharp Masking:
