### Huffman coding
- To compress images, we have to calculate the entropy (avg number of bits needs to represent the image).

- How to do Huffman coding:
  - Compute and sort the probability of each pixel (in descended order).
  - From bottom up, sum the 2 lowest probabilities (). Re-order the probability of pixels after summation.

  - Do above step untill we have only 2 rows. Use 1 bit to represent these 2 values. Trackback the route we have created, at each stage, we will use one more addition bit to represent the new pixel.
  - Important: To make sure that the computer doesn't confuse, the coding have to has different prefix. i.e:
