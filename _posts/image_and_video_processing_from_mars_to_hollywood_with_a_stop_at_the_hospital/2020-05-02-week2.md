### Huffman coding
- To compress images, we have to calculate the entropy (avg number of bits needs to represent the image).

- Assumption: Some pixel values repeat alot and others don't appear. We can get this assumption by quantize the image (see below).

- How to do Huffman coding:
  - Compute and sort the probability of each pixel (in descended order).
  - From bottom up, sum the 2 lowest probabilities (). Re-order the probability of pixels after summation.

  - Do above step untill we have only 2 rows. Use 1 bit to represent these 2 values. Trackback the route we have created, at each stage, we will use one more addition bit to represent the new pixel.
  - Important: To make sure that the computer doesn't confuse, the coding have to has different prefix. i.e:

  - The result is, pixel values with low probality will be represented by short codes; high probability will be represented by long codes.
  
### JPEG Compression
- Step 1: Divide images into 8x8 blocks
- Step 2: Transform 8x8 blocks by using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform). We can do this by multiply these block with DCT's matrix (this is a known matrix).

- Step 3: Quantization
  - Use lesser bits to represent a pixel value and the number of bits are used to represent different pixel values is different. i.e: '1' will be represent by 1 bit while 7 will be represent by 3 bits, ...
  - Basically to do this by divide the intervals, pixels belong to each interval will be represented by the same value.
  - In JPEG, instead of divide intervals, they use **div** function and they build a fixed matrix to do **div** function.

  - This will help us to get small the number of pixel values after quantization, so that good for Huffman coding. 
- Step 4: Encoding using Huffman coding
