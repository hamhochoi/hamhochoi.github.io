## WEEK 6: PDEs (Partial Differential Geometry )

### Planar Differential Geometry 
- Affine Transformation: Change the shape of the boundary/curve
- Euclidean Transformation: Preserve the shape, change the rotation, location of the boundary/curve.

- Equi-Affine Transformation: Preserve the area/square of the object inside the boundary, can change the shape, location, rotation of the object.
