## WEEK 6: PDEs (Partial Differential Geometry)
- Assumpt that images are continuous.
- Different approach with the approach that apply [-1, 1] into images to get gradients.


### Planar Differential Geometry 

- Curve: 
  - C(p) = {x(p), y(p)}, p belongs to [0,1]
  - With each value of p, we have a point on the curve --> looks like function.
  
- Important concept of curve on plane:
  - Tangent (Tiếp tuyến): When we get derivative of a curve at a point, we get the tangent of the curve at that point (just like function ~ line formula).
  ![](plane_curve_1.png)
  - Curvature: The derivative of tangent show how fast the tangent changing.
    - With each parameter 'p', we can calculate the 's' to have the curvature vector is perpendicular (vuông góc) with the tangent. <C(s), C(ss)> = 0

- Affine Transformation: Change the shape of the boundary/curve
- Euclidean Transformation: Preserve the shape, change the rotation, location of the boundary/curve.

  - When apply the Euclidean transform, **the diagram** show the relationship of **points and the curvature** at these points are **the same**.

  --> Help to define a curve in plane.
- Equi-Affine Transformation: Preserve the area/square of the object inside the boundary, can change the shape, location, rotation of the object.

  - 
- Arclength (Độ dài của đường cong):
  - Euclidean transform: The length of curve is the same after apply euclidean transform.
  - Equi-Affine transform: The length of curve is not the same but the area of the curve is the same after applying Equi-Affine transform --> Need 2 vectors to represents the area (1st and 2nd derivative).
    - The 2 vectors are not perpendicular in general. Chose the parameter 'v' (corresponding to the 2 vectors) w.r.t area made from them is equal to 1. We can calculate 'v' by the following picture
    ![](equi_affine_arclength.png)
    - The curvature of the curve at each point (after calculate the vector 'v') can be define as in the below picture
    ![](equi_affine_arclength_2.png)
    - The parameters <v, (curvature at point v)> define the curve and be unchanged after applying equi-affine tranform.

### Surface Differential Geometry
- Properties of surface: ![](surface.png)
  - A surface is defined by 2 parameters (u, v)
  - Normal vector: cross product (tích có hướng) of S(u), S(v) -the derivative by 2 parameters- and then normalize that vector. This perpendicular with the plane contain (S(u), S(v)) by defination of cross product.
  - The area defined by the derivative by 2 papameters.
  - The area of the surface = calculate the area with all u, v parameters of the surface.
    - Normal curvature: Get one curve, compute second derivative vector, project it into Normal vector of the curve
    - At one point, we have multiple curve but we care most about Pricipal Curvatures (max and min curvature)
    - Mean/Gaussian Curvature can be computed from max and min curvature.

### Curve Evolution
- Velocity vector: Partial Derivative of curve at paramter 'p' by 't'-time.
![](curve_evolution_1.png)
- When we decompose the velocity vector, the tangential part doesn't affect the shape of the curve
![](curve_evolution_2.png)
- We have a curve then we transform this curve with euclidean transform. At each time (t), if we compute the velocity of the origin and the transformed curve, we will have the same result.
![](curve_evolution_3.png)

- Curvature Flow: 
  - Starting with any shape of curve.
  - Firstly, apply the velocity formular, we have a convex.
  - Repeat applying velocity formular, the curve get smoother and after all, we have a round point (circle)
![](curve_flow.png)  

- Curve Flow for Affine transform:
![](curve_evolution_4.png)

- Some formula for changing length, area, curvature after apply de-information (velocity)
  ![](curve_evolution_5.png)
- Time needed to make the curve become rounded point: 
![](curve_evolution_6.png)

- Active contour: We can add some terms in C(t) to make it stop when the curve meet the boundary of the objects.
  - g(x, y) is the derivative of the image. The formula says that when we meet the boundary (gradient is very high) --> Stop shrinking.

### Level Sets
- Properties:
  - ![](level_set_1.png)
  - ![](level_set_1.png)

- With level sets, we just need the formula 'phi', we don't need to know the curve.
--> We can compute the curvature with 'phi' only. To compute derivative, just apply [-1, 1] vector.

- De-information with level set
 ![](level_set_3.png)

- Why level set is important: We don't have to worry about changes in topology (i.e when apply constant flow, topology can be splitted.)

### Anisotropic Diffusion
- Denoising method.
- Averaging pixels inside the same boundary.
![](anisotropic_diffusion.png)


### Active Contour
- Start with an image
- Smooth and Edge Detection. 
  - At edges after edge detection, the gray value is very high; otherwise, the value is low.
  - We need to find edge curves. We can do this by curve evolution, with the function g(x, y); the evolution stop at the edges.
